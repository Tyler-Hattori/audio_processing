# Audio Processing Workspace
A place to store my guitar clips and write scripts that can process them in various ways. First I want to grasp basic ASP concepts, then workshop some ideas I have that would be useful for a musician.

## Goals
- Add effects to a given recording (reverb, delay, echo, chorus, flanger, EQ, filtering, compression, gating, limiting, distortion, remove note onsets)
- Generate a stereo recording from any number of mono audio clips with desired panning angles and relative volumes
- Noise cancellation (performance comparison between adaptive LMS filter, Weiner filter, and a custom DNN)
- Source separation

## Random Project Idea
Given a recording of a song, isolate the guitar. Then, estimate a filter that can take a recording of me playing the riff on the guitar and add the proper effect. I wonder if this could work to change the timbre of the guitar to other intruments.

## Prerequisites
Anaconda.

## Installation
Create and activate a conda environment. Run setup.py.
